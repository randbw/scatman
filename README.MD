## Pure Bliss

Was playing around with `say` one sleep deprived evening and thought I should
write a script which raises my mood every time I remember it exists. This is
the result.

For a good time, `./scatman`.

For a better time try with one of the listed voices.

For 24/7 best time ever run `./linkScriptForMac`.

N.B.:
- I've only written the script for mac currently. Will do one for ubuntu when
  I use ubuntu regularly again
- Symlink script is very basic. Does not handle errors nor install. All in time.
